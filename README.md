# iVAE-Causality-in-Air-Quality
## Introduction
Air pollution is a significant environmental concern that affects the health and well-being of millions of people around the world. Understanding the underlying factors and relationships between various pollutants is crucial for devising effective interventions and improving air quality. This project, iVAE-Causality-in-Air-Quality, aims to explore the causal relationships among different air quality indicators using an Invariant Variational Autoencoder (iVAE).

Traditional correlation-based methods can struggle to identify true causal links due to the complex and intertwined nature of environmental data. By leveraging iVAE, this project adopts a modern approach to causal inference that aims to reveal invariant relationships between pollutants under different conditions, which are often masked by noise or hidden variables.
